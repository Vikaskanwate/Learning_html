        <h2><i>History</i></h2>
        <p>The initial construction of Lohagad Fort is attributed to the Lohtamia dynasty, who ruled the region during the 10<sup>th</sup> century <abbr title="Common Era">CE</abbr>, the fort was under them for the longest period. [1]

        Lohagad has a long history with several dynasties occupying it at different periods of time:<strong> Lohtamia, Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, Yadavas, Bahamanis, Nizams, Mughals and Marathas. Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj </strong> it in 1648 AD, but he was forced to surrender it to the Mughals in 1665 AD by the Treaty of Purandar. Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj recaptured the fort in 1670 AD and used it for keeping his treasury. This fort was used to keep the winnings from Surat. Later in Peshwa time Nana Phadnavis used this fort for living for some time and built several structures in the fort such as a big tank and a step-well.
        Lohagad is part of the Western Ghats. It rises to an elevation of 1,033 m (3,389 ft) above sea level, and is located to the southwest of the larger Visapur fort. The range divides the basins of the Indrayani river and Pavana lake. Lohagad overlooks the Pavana reservoir, located to the south of the mountain. <mark>The hill extends to the northwest to a fortified spur, called Vinchukada (Scorpion's tail) because of its resembling shape </mark>. The four large gates of Lohagad are still in good condition and reasonably intact.

During the monsoon, the top of the fort is covered with mist and clouds and becomes particularly wet with growing moss. The roads and trails leading to the hill are quite slippery at this time of the year and precautions are necessary to be taken while venturing the routes.
